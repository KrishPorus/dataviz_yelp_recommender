By making decisions regarding the family's allocation of time and financial resources, students develop a greater understanding of the manifold disciplines -- such as agronomy, nutrition, economics, epidemiology, public health and development management -- that constitute sustainable development and how those disciplines interact with each other in \"real world\" scenarios. The simulation's creators hope that, by immersing themselves in the daily life of a family, students will identify more deeply with the local experience of extreme poverty.</p>\n\n<p>The simulation was created as a study tool for students in Professor Jeffrey Sachs' undergraduate course Challenges of Sustainable Development, and is freely available to sustainable development practitioners and the general public.</p>",

Students use the website to pursue original research from primary materials, design comparative analyses by quoting concrete examples of performances, and assemble excerpts from Web archives. Students use their research to take the course in directions that are more relevant to their lives. With easy access to a critical mass of specifically selected media, students are able to revisit previous units, locate additional curricular through-lines, and discuss their findings in facilitated discussion and collaboration spaces.</p>",

  "fulldescription": "<p>This tool assists in exploring cinema's visual syntax through its arrangement of shots and organization. Students use the Deconstructor to view and dissect film scenes into series of shots, allowing them to focus on examining the components of the whole in order to layer and juxtapose variables across time. Students can view film scenes, excerpt a series of shots from the scene, and provide a description of each shot by considering the common variables such as shot type, time and angle. The information from each excerpt of the film will then become part of a larger visualization synchronizing the shots chosen by the student, with a graphical representation of their descriptions. This aims to provide a sense of score for each scene and material that probes further analysis. The further analysis will take place in the form of a final paper using the data students have generated in the Deconstructor as their primary source material.</p>\n\n<p>See original web page: <a href=\"http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/engel/deconstructor/\">http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/engel/deconstructor/</a></p>",

Each literary work or imprint represents a moment in time and space when an idea was conceived and documented, and in some cases shared with a chosen few, or distributed widely across regions or continents. Each copy of the imprint also has its own history to share. This history is the essence of Footprints. The history of the book is an important part of humanities studies that has seen a resurgence as more books are digitized, emphasizing the importance of individual books as objects with their own unique story to tell. Jewish books in particular have a fascinating story to tell about the spread of knowledge and faith in the Diaspora, in societies that often persecuted it's practitioners.</p>\n\n<p>The site was developed through a collaboration of researchers from the Jewish Theological Seminary, Columbia University, University of Pittsburgh, and Stony Brook University, as well as other partner institutions.</p>",
