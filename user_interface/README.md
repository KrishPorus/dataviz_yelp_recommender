Keshif
======

**Keshif** is a visual data browser that makes it easier to browse and understand your data. It presents visual summaries of your data properties, such as who, what, when and where, in its facets and timeline. You can discover relations between attributes through exploration. Filtering follows a consistent design within and across facets. After each step of exploration, the most relevant results and data properties are shown first, as they are dynamically and smoothly re-ordered.
